# superWeatherApp

- Clone the repo
- Run in a terminal pointing to the app root `npm install` then `node server.js`
- Run in a separate terminal pointing to root/client `npm install` then `npm run build` then `npm start`
- Voila!

**NOTE**
  - Forcasting data for next week is only available through a paid license, so I skipped it :)
